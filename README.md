## Technical Test Statement

Create an application to search for movies.

- API to use: - <https://www.omdbapi.com/>
  - Get the API Key on the website by registering your email.

Requirements:

- Needs to display an input for searching the movie and a button to perform the
search.

- List the movies and display the title, year, and poster.

- Ensure that the form functions properly.

- Make the movies display in a responsive grid.

- Implement data fetching from the API.

First iteration:

- Prevent the same search from being performed twice in a row.

- Make the search happen automatically while typing.

- Avoid continuous searching while typing (debounce).
